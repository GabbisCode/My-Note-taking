Run your editor and type in the following program exactly as it' s written. Be careful to use the punctuation exactly as you see here. Make sure you enter the brackets that are on the fourth and last lines as braces—the curly ones {}, not the square brackets [ ] or the parentheses ( )—it really does matter. Also, make sure you put the forward slashes the right way (/), as later you' ll be using the backslash (\) as well. Don' t forget the semicolon (;).
