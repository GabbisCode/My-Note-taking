# Operators

Operators are functions that use a symbolic name, they perform mathematical or logical functions. Operators are predefined in C, just like they are in most other languages, and most operators tend to be combined with the **infix style**.

A *logical operator* (sometimes called a "Boolean operator") is an operator that returns a Boolean result that's based on the Boolean result of one or two other expressions. An *arithmetic operator* is a mathematical function that takes two operands and performs a calculation on them. Other operators include assignment, relational (<, >, !=), bitwise (<<, >>, ~).

## Expressions and Statements

### Expression

Statements form the basic program steps of C, and most statements are constructed from expressions. An expression consists of a combination of operators and operands. Operands are what an operator operates on. Operands can be constants, variables, or combinations of the two. Every expression has a value. There are some expressions: -6, 4+21, a*(b + c/d)/20, q = 5*2, x = ++q % 3, q > 3

### Statements

Statements are the building blocks of a program (declaration). A program is a series of statements with special syntax ending with a semicolon (simple statements). A statement is a complete instruction to the computer.

```c
int Jason; //Declaration statement
```

```c
Jason = 5; //Assignment Statement
```

```c
printf("Jason"); //Function call statement
```

```c
while (Jason < 20) Jason = Jason + 1; //Structure Statement
```

```c
return 0; //Return Statement
```

C considers any expression to be a statement if you append a semicolon (expression statements), so, 8; and 3-4; are perfectly valid in C.

#### Compound Statements

Two or more statements grouped together by enclosing them in braces (block).

```c
int index = 0;
while (index < 10)
{
printf("hello");
index = index + 1;
}
```

## Basic Operators

An **arithmetic** operator is a mathematical function that takes two operands and performs a calculation on them. A **logical** operator (sometimes called a "Boolean operator") is an operator that returns a Boolean result that's based on the Boolean result of one or two other expressions. **Assignment** operators set variables equal to values. It assigns the value of the expression at its
right to the variable at its left. A **relational** operator will compare variables against each other.

### Arithmetic Operators

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
  int a = 33;
  int b = 15;
  
  printf("The result a is %d.\n", --a); //32
  printf("The result b is %d.\n", b++); //15
  printf("There are the new result of b %d.", b++); //16

  return 0;
}
```

## Bitwise Operators

C offers bitwise logical operators and shift operators. They look something like the logical operators you saw earlier but are quite different and operate on the bits in integer values. They are not used in the common program.

One major use of the bitwise AND, &, and the bitwise OR, I, is in operations to test and set individual bits in an integer variable. They can use individual bits to store data that involve one of two choices. You could use a single integer variable to store several characteristics of a person:

* store whether the person is male or female with one bit
* use three other bits to specify whether the person can speak French, German, or Italian
* another bit to record whether the person's salary is $50,000 or more
* in just four bits you have a substantial set of data recorded

### Binary Numbers

A binary number is a number that includes only ones and zeroes. The number could be of any length. The following are all examples of binary numbers: 0, 10101, 1, 0101010, 10, 1011110101, 01, 0110101110, 111000, 000111

Every Binary number has a corresponding Decimal value (and vice versa), examples:

| Binary Numbercol | Decimal Equivalentcol |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| 1                | 1                     |
| 10               | 2                     |
| 11               | 3                     |
| ...              | ...                   |
| 1010111          | 87                    |

Each position for a binary number has a value. For each digit, multiply the digit by its position value, add up all of the products to get the final result. **In general, the "position values" in a binary number are the powers of two.** The first position value is 2^0, i.e. one. The 2nd position value is 2^1 , i.e. two. The 2nd position value is 2^2, i.e. four. The 2nd position value is 2^3 , i.e. eight. The 2nd position value is 2^4 , i.e. sixteen, etc.

![Binary_Numbers01](image/Binary_Numbers01.png)

**From right to left: 1+8+32+64 = 105;**

**from left to right: ((1+1\*2)\*2\*2+1)\*2\*2\*2+1 = 105**

![Binary_Numbers02](image/Binary_Numbers02.png)

**From right to left: 4+8+16+128 = 156;**

**from left to right: (((1\*2\*2\*2+1)\*2+1)\*2+1)\*2\*2 = 156**

### Bitwise Operators (tutorials point)

![Bitwise_Operators](image/Bitwise_Operators.png)

There are  a couple key things you need to know, when you need to **shift left to right**. First of all we know that unsigned int means that it only can be positive, so if you store an nagetive value in there, the compiler's conversion- will be longer and takes up a lot of sizes.

#### Binary AND&, Binary OR

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
  unsigned int a = 60; // 0011 1100
  unsigned int b = 13; // 0000 1101
  int result = 0;

  result = a & b; // 0000 1100
  printf("The result is %d.\n", result);

  result = a | b; // 0011 1101
  printf("The result is %d.", result);

  return 0;
}
```

#### Binary Left Shift<<, Binary Right Shift>>

```c
int main()
{
  unsigned int a = 60; // 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 1100
  int result = 0;

  result = a << 2; // 1111 0000
  printf("The result is %d.", result); //240

  result = a >> 4; //0000 0011
  printf("The result is %d.", result); //3

  return 0;
}
```

### Truth Table

## The Cast and sizeof Operators

### Type Conversions

Conversion of data between different types can happen automatically (implicit conversion) by the language or explicit by the program. To effectively develop C programs, you must understand the rules used for the implicit conversion of floating-point and integer values in C.

Normally, you shouldn't mix types, but there are occasions when it is useful. Remember, C is flexible, gives you the freedom, but, do not abuse it. Whenever a floating-point value is assigned to an integer variable in C, the decimal portion of the number gets truncated.

```c
int x = 0;
float f=12.125;

x = f; // value stored in x is the number 12, only the int portion is stored
```

Assigning an integer variable to a floating variable does not cause any change in the value of the number. Value is converted by the system and stored in the floating variable.

When performing integer arithmetic: if two operands in an expression are integers then any decimal portion resulting from a division, operation is discarded, even if the result is assigned to a floating variable. If one operand is an int and the other is a float then the operation is performed as a floating point operation.

### The Cast Operator

As mentioned, you should usually steer clear of automatic type conversions, especially of demotions, so it's better to do an explicit conversion.

It is possible for you to demand the precise type conversion that you want. It's called a cast and consists of preceding the quantity with the name of the desired type in parentheses. Parentheses and type name together constitute a cast operator, i.e. (type). The actual type desired, such as long, is substituted for the word type.

The type cast operator has a higher precedence than all the arithmetic operators except the unary minus and unary plus.

```c
(int) 21.51 + (int) 26.99 //21 + 26
```

### sizeof operator

You can find out how many bytes are occupied in memory by a given type by using the sizeof operator. sizeof is a special keyword in C.  sizeof is actually an operator, and not a function. It's evaluated at compile time and not at runtime, unless a variable-length array is used in its argument.

The argument to the sizeof operator can be a variable, an array name, the name of a basic data type, the name of a derived data type, or an expression. sizeof(int) will result in the number of bytes occupied by a variable of type int. You can also apply the sizeof operator to an expression, and the result is the size of the value that results from evaluating the expression.

Use the sizeof operator wherever possible to avoid having to calculate and hard-code sizes into your program.

### Other Operators

The asterisk "\*" is an operator that represents a pointer to a variable.

```c
*a; //pointer
```

The ternary operator ***?:***  is an operator used for comparisons. If Condition is true ? then value X : otherwise value Y.

## Operator Precedence

Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. It dictates the order of evaluation when two operators share an operand. Certain operators have higher precedence than others. For example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.

```c
x = 7 + 3*2; //13
```

The order of executing the various operations can make a difference, so C needs unambiguous rules for choosing what to do first. In C, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +. First gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.

Each operator is assigned a precedence level. Multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction, so they are performed first. Whatever is enclosed in parentheses is
executed first, should just always use () to group expressions.

### Associativity

What if two operators have the same precedence? Then associativity rules are applied. If they share an operand, they are executed according to the order in which they occur in the statement. For most operators, the order is from left to right.

```c
1 == 2 != 3; //1
```

Operators == and != have same precedence. The associativity of both == and != is left to right. The expression on the left is executed first and moves towards the right. The expression above is equivalent to

```c
((1 ==2)!= 3);
//(1 == 2) executes first resulting into 0 (false), then, (0 != 3) executes resulting into 1 (true)
```
